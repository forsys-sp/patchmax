## Description

Patchmax is a computational module designed to explore spatially explicit landscape treatment projects. The package can be used to prioritize treatment locations on relatively small landscapes (project level implementation, 1,000 ha) to large landscapes (national forest to multi-regional planning efforts, 1 million ha). Although patchmax was originally designed for hazardous fuel treatment planning in forested systems, it can be applied to fiber production, habitat restoration, and other resource management problems. Patchmax utilizes breadth-first search in the igraph package to sequence stands within the projects. To improve efficiency, the application implements binary searches with data.table package while running on a parallel computing platform with doParallel package.
Dependences: R (>= 4.0.3) and packages (igraph, data.table, sf, doParallel, parallel)
